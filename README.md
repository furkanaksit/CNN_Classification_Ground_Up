Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Network

  *Reading images in grayscale
   
  *Split data to train and test
  
  *Construct the layers
  
  *Build the train function
  
  *Build the loss function
  
  *Do backpropogation according to loss function using gradient descent
  
  *Use test data to approximate the success
  
Starting to code without any knowledge of deeplearning we will learn along the way
